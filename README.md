# Shopping-Express-Project (Intangicart)
Have you ever wanted to shop for physical versions of NFTs or Cryptos? Look no further, your one-stop metaphysical shop for the ownership of things that don't have value unless you trade them is here! Now selling used paper USD!

Project description
	Intangicart provides a platform for users to securely buy and sell Intangible products, such as NFTS, printable files, tickets and other Intangible needs. Users are able to come in and create products, decide the price they would like to list the products for, provide an image and a name. Users can also visit the shop to purchase other listed items from other users. The shop features the items for sale, and allows for the user to purchase the product, while updating their wallets balance and the sellers balance. The user is then freely able to edit this product or even delete it. The user's profile is editable, allowing them to customize how they are perceived in Intangicart. Once a user is done they can easily logout just as they logged in, via Google Authentication. In the future Intagicart has plans to build out search functionality on our Shop page, allow users to host their items on Intagicart, without having them listed for sale, and have access to various other file types besides just images currently. Additionally, the in app currency is not a real currency, every new user is awarded 10,000 units to spend as they would like, we plan in the future to integrate more real world payment mechanisms. 

How to use Intagicart
